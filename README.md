# Crowded_Highway

In this study, a project showing the car density on the highway was made with the object detection model [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). The highest performance YOLOv5x was used as the model. 

It varies according to the car density of the bar in the lower right corner. In the upper right corner, the number of cars and trucks on the highway is written instantly. You can see the output below.
